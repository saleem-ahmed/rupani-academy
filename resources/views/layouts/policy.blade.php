                    This admission policy is based on the principles of transparency, equitability and fairness in
                    aiming towards providing quality education. Rupani Academy is a diverse community of students,
                    faculty, and staff members from a wide range of economic, cultural, social, and geographical
                    (rural/urban), linguistic, and religious backgrounds. The school engages a diverse community of
                    students. Therefore, we welcome students and faculty from diverse communities locally and globally
                    in our school (Rupani Academy). The Academy shall make all possible endeavours to ensure that
                    students admitted in school benefit from the educational and recreational provisions at the academy
                    and are successful in achieving their social, emotional and learning goals.
                    Nonetheless, it is understood that not all students would be able to benefit from the model of
                    education established at Rupani Academy, thus a comprehensive policy is designed to help the school
                    leadership team in identifying such students and allow them to make the best of facilities
                    available.
                    Rupani Academy does not guarantee admission to every applicant and reserves the right to deny
                    admission to any applicant if, it appears to the admission committee, that doing so is in the best
                    interest of the school and/or the student.
