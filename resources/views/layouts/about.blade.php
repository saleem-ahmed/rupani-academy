                <p>Rupani Academy is based on an ideal to abridge the hiatuses in conventional ecosystem of education.
                    Our years of experience in the education field persuaded us to move forward and take the
                    responsibility of setting a new trend by introducing curriculum and education systems as per the
                    need and requirement of the progressing and developing world. After pioneering in Early Childhood
                    Development (ECD) in Pakistan Rupani Academy now aims to bring International Baccalaureate (IB)
                    curriculum in Gilgit-Baltistan for the first time to nurture students as global contributing
                    citizens.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Rupani Academy (RA) was founded on a simple belief that access to quality education is crucial for
                    unleashing the real potential of mountain communities. Inspired by their resilience and values, our
                    aim was to create an educational system which promotes inquiry based learning, critical thinking,
                    leadership, inclusion and democratic values. Following our traditions of going extra miles in
                    providing marginalized communities with quality education, skill development and learning resources,
                    Rupani Academy spent years of planning for a world class educational institution that would bring
                    excellence and brilliance to children living in the mountainous valleys of Gilgit Baltistan. The
                    curriculum, campus, teaching and learning programs, sports, critical thinking and social development
                    practices at Rupani Academy are realizations of the same dream of bringing excellence and brilliance
                    to the communities.</p>
